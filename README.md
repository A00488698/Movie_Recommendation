### Explanation of the Code
#### What It Does:
1. **Loads Movie Data**: Reads the `u.item` file from the MovieLens dataset and extracts movie titles and genres.
2. **Processes Features**: Uses movie genres as features to compute similarity.
3. **Computes Similarity Matrix**: Uses cosine similarity to compare movies based on genre.
4. **Takes User Input**: Allows the user to input up to 5 favorite movies, if they want stop, just press Enter to finish.
5. **Generates Recommendations**: Suggests up to 10 movies similar to the input ones, along with explanations.

#### What It Doesn’t Do:
   - It **does not** consider user ratings—recommendations are purely based on genre similarity.
   - It **does not** factor in popularity or recent trends.
   - It **does not** handle typos in movie names; users need to enter exact titles.
   - It **cannot** recommend movies that are not in the dataset.
   - It **cannot** detect or correct movie titles that are not in the dataset; if a movie name is entered incorrectly, no recommendations will be provided.

#### Algorithm Used:
   - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between movies based on genre vectors.

#### Assumptions:
   - Users input exact movie titles from the dataset.
   - Movies with similar genres have a high probability of being liked together.
   - The dataset is clean and free from missing genre information.
